# shit.is

This is a code player that allows you to run HTML, CSS and JS code.

The output window shows live/real-time result so there's no need to compile the code and run the code to see the output.
It already has toggle buttons for each of the windows which allows users to see or unsee them at will.

More functionalities like sign-up & login, light & dark themes, css enable & disable button, etc will soon be added.
Suggestions and ideas are more than welcome.

Thanks
